## How to Play the Game

1. The goal is to catch pikachus and take them to the shrines at the top row.
2. Use the keyboard's arrow keys to move the pokeball. Avoid other moving pokemons because pikachu is what you are after. When you hit one of those moving pokemons, you lose one pokeball. You may see the number of empty pokeballs below the canvas.
3. The game setting also includes rocks, snorlaxes(good) and pyducks(bad).
  - You can only move around rocks.
  - If you catch a snorlax, it will gift you one pokeball.
  - Pyducks are extremely dangerous, I would not suggest catching them.
